            <p>We are a family-driven organization on a mission to connect loving pets with their forever homes using technology and compassion.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Adopt became an idea when founders Paul and Makayla Rodriguez were looking to adopt a new dog. Going to each shelter's website was a hit or miss.
                After driving for hours, they finally met Scooby! This service is meant to save people time, money, gas, and frustration.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Paul and Makayla always had a passion for helping pets get out of shelters and into loving homes. Adopt was created to also create a better
                opportunity for animals to live a better life while improving our lives!

            <br>
            <strong><p>It all began from a real experience. Your best friend is a click away.</p></strong>
